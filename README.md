# Random-Photo-Gallery
This project displays 6 random photos using the Lorem Pixel API. Images are arranged in a custom 4+2 grid layout, and users can load a new set of photos with a button click. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a great beginner-friendly project for practicing DOM manipulation and API integration
